🤖 Project Title

JARVIS – Python-Based Virtual Voice Assistant

🧠 Project Overview

JARVIS is a Python-based virtual voice assistant that performs tasks based on voice commands given by the user. It uses speech recognition to understand commands and text-to-speech to respond like a human assistant. The project automates daily tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, telling time, and more.

🎯 Objectives

To build a voice-controlled assistant using Python

To automate daily computer tasks

To improve understanding of Python libraries

To implement AI-based interaction using speech

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

speech_recognition – for voice input

pyttsx3 – for text-to-speech

datetime – for time & date

wikipedia – for searching information

webbrowser – for opening websites

os – for system operations

⚙️ Features of JARVIS

🎙️ Listens to voice commands

🗣️ Responds with voice output

🕒 Tells current time and date

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Voice Input

The assistant listens to the user's voice through a microphone.

2️⃣ Speech Recognition

The spoken command is converted into text using Python libraries.

3️⃣ Command Processing

The program checks the command and decides which task to perform.

4️⃣ Task Execution

The requested task is executed (search, open app, tell time).

5️⃣ Voice Response

JARVIS replies back using text-to-speech.
